# Diphoton MVA Optimizer

This is repository containing a small framework to derive the optimal bdt category boundaries for the H to diphoton precision mass analysis

## Motivation

Something similar was built in spring 2019, but is now outdated. This is an updated more efficient version using python.  
The purpose of this software is to derive the optimal boundaries in the diphoton mva space using the resolution of the diphoton invariant mass as a target.
